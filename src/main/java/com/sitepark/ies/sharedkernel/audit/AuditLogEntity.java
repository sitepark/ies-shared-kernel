/**
 * Represents a single audit entry describing a domain-relevant change within the system.
 *
 * <p>An {@code AuditLog} captures a state change that occurred on a specific domain entity, such as
 * a user, role, or privilege, and is typically emitted by a bounded context as part of a business
 * operation. Audit logs are domain-agnostic and do not contain any logic themselvesâ€” they serve as
 * traceable, interpretable records for inspection, compliance, and potential reversal.
 *
 * <p>This record contains metadata about the change, including:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the affected entity type and identifier
 *   <li>the nature of the action performed (e.g. create, update, remove)
 *   <li>the previous and new state in serialized form (usually JSON)
 *   <li>information about the user and authority responsible for the change
 *   <li>an optional batch ID linking this entry to a group of related changes
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Typical use cases include:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Auditable change history for sensitive data
 *   <li>Undo support for reversible business operations
 *   <li>Monitoring and reporting across bounded contexts
 * </ul>
